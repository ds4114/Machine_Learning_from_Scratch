# Machine_Learning_from_Scratch
Implementations of machine learning with minimal packages

This repo contains several implementations of common machine learning techniques but executed on small sample datasets without the use of sklearn (i.e. using numpy matrix multiplication and probabilistic modeling) to teach and show the underlying mechanics. Python package requirements can be found in the requirements.yml file.

- 01 Naive Bayes
- 02 Logistic Regression (with and without Newton's Method of Gradient Ascent)
- 03 Gaussian Kernel Regression (Radial Basis Function)
- 04 Exponential Regression (manual optimization) - pending #TODO

#TODO: add more instructions and comments to python files. Insert math formula as text or images.
